## Description
YouMood is a static responsive web page where the user can select his actual emotional state (e.g. rainy, on-fire, meditative) by clicking on the correspondent button, and gets music suggestions classified by genre in the form of random songs.

## MVP

- Sign up-form and log-in form must have some validation format (i.e. password must be longer than 6 characters, email require @).
- The user data should be storage in local storage

## Backlog
